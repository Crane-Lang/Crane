# Crane

[![CI](https://github.com/crane-lang/crane/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/crane-lang/crane/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

> ⚠️ Crane is still very early in development.

Crane is a programming language for writing robust and elegant software that will endure over time.

It is statically typed, compiles down to native machine code, and will someday have a garbage collector. It draws inspiration from languages like Rust and the ML family of languages (Standard ML, OCaml, F#).

Crane comes with all the features you need to write reliable software:

- A static, strong, and sound type system
- Sum types<sup>&dagger;</sup>, like `Option` and `Result`
- Pattern matching<sup>&dagger;</sup> with exhaustiveness checks
- Generics<sup>&dagger;</sup>

The inclusion of features alone is not what makes a good language. Equally important are the features that are not present:

- No `null` or `undefined`
- No inheritance
- No exceptions

<sup>&dagger;</sup>Not yet implemented.
